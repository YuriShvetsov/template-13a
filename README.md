`npm i` - install modules

The objectives that were pursued when creating the layout:
- semantically correct approaches to creating a structure,
- using the **BEM** methodology (block, element, modifier),
- preprocessor **SCSS (SASS)**,
- use of **HTML5** and **CSS3** standards,
- use of **Flexbox** and **Grid** technology,
- responsive design with **media queries**,
- implementation of third-party libraries, open-source solutions and plug-ins,
- familiarization with the **npm** package manager,
- partial use of **Gulp** features.
